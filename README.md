# CSF214

The following repository contains course slides and programming assignment for the undergraduate course [Logic in Computer Science](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/uploads/Pilani_Upload/Dept_Computer_Science_and_Information_Systems/Handouts/logic.pdf) (CS F214) at BITS Pilani.

## Assignment
The assignment aims to encode 3 chapters (Ch. 4, 5, 6) of the Indian Penal Code using predicate logic. Given a set of premises it infers if the action is guilt or not given the rule set we have formed. To better understand the usecase we recommend browsing through [testcases.txt](https://github.com/anirudhb11/CSF214/blob/main/assignment/testcase.txt) where we show how premises are constructed.

## How to run?
Refer to [instructions.txt](https://github.com/anirudhb11/CSF214/blob/main/assignment/instructions.txt)
